# FaceRec Pro: Anti-Class Skipping System 🛡️

![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

**FaceRec Pro** is a premium, real-time surveillance and attendance management system powered by Face Recognition and AI. It is designed to monitor student presence across multiple locations (e.g., Classroom & Corridors) and automatically alert authorities via email in case of unauthorized absence or "skipping".

> [!NOTE]
> This is a functional prototype designed for dual-camera setups. It can utilize a laptop's default camera and an external USB webcam to simulate two distinct monitoring zones.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🔍 Advanced AI Detection
- **YOLOv11 Integration**: High-speed, accurate face localization.
- **Deep Face Recognition**: Real-time identification using specialized embeddings and distance matching.
- **Dual Camera Architecture**: Simultaneous processing of "Classroom" (primary) and "Corridor" (secondary) feeds.

### 🔐 Secure Authentication
- **Glassmorphic Auth**: Modern, high-end login and signup interfaces.
- **Forgot Password with OTP**: Secure password recovery system using 6-digit email OTPs.
- **Session Management**: Secure user sessions for administrative access.

### 🚨 Intelligent Alerts & Logging
- **Missing Student Tracking**: Detects when a student who was present in class is missing for more than a configurable threshold.
- **Automated Email Alerts**: Instant notifications sent to administrators with timestamps.
- **Corridor Detection**: Logs when a "missing" student is spotted in the corridor.
- **Automated Attendance**: Mark attendance automatically upon facial recognition.

### 📺 Management & Monitoring
- **CCTV Monitor Mode**: A clean, raw dual-feed monitor for traditional security viewing.
- **Management Dashboard**: Real-time statistics, attendance charts, and recent activity logs.
- **Detailed Reports**: Comprehensive searchable logs of all attendance and alert events.
